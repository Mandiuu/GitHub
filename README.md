# Music Gender
 
Gender Bias in Music is the theory that people prefer to listen to more male singers than female singers. But how do you know if this is the case for you? With a code! 
This is the code to see how many male and female artists you listen to in your Spotify playlists. You can see the result of your favorite playlist or see how many female artists Spotify recommends you to listen to. 
You can also see which are the most played songs of your favorite band and how many times it has been played.
